# Traditional Chinese Testing Guide

## Current Status ✅
Your print server is now running with enhanced Traditional Chinese support!

## What We Fixed 🔧

1. **Enhanced Character Detection**: The server now automatically detects Traditional vs Simplified Chinese characters
2. **Multiple Encoding Support**: 
   - Big5 encoding for Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
   - GBK encoding for Simplified Chinese (简体中文)
   - GB2312 and UTF-8 as fallbacks
3. **Smart Priority System**: Traditional Chinese text gets Big5 encoding first, Simplified gets GBK first

## Testing Steps 📝

### Method 1: Use the Web Interface
1. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/test
2. Scroll down to the "Chinese Print Test" section
3. Try these test texts:

**Traditional Chinese:**
```
繁體中文測試
港式茶餐廳
謝謝光臨！
歡迎再來
```

**Simplified Chinese:**
```
简体中文测试
港式茶餐厅
谢谢光临！
欢迎再来
```

**Mixed Text:**
```
HK Savor Spoon 港式美味
简体：欢迎光临
繁體：歡迎光臨
Thank you 謝謝 谢谢
```

### Method 2: Use PowerShell Commands
Open a new PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
# Test Traditional Chinese
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/print -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{\"text\":\"繁體中文測試：謝謝光臨！\", \"api_key\":\"hk_savor_spoon_2024\"}'

# Test Simplified Chinese  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/print -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{\"text\":\"简体中文测试：谢谢光临！\", \"api_key\":\"hk_savor_spoon_2024\"}'
```

### Method 3: Run Test Scripts
In your printer_server folder, run:
```powershell
python simple_test.py
```

## What to Check 🔍

After printing, check your Star TSP100 output:

1. **Traditional Chinese characters** (繁體中文) should display correctly, not as squares or garbled text
2. **Simplified Chinese characters** (简体中文) should display correctly  
3. **Mixed text** should show both character sets properly
4. **English and numbers** should still work normally

## Troubleshooting 🔧

If Traditional Chinese still shows as squares:

1. **Check Printer Character Set**: 
   - Print a test page from your Star TSP100 settings
   - Look for "Character Set" or "字符集" options
   - Try setting it to "繁體中文" or "Big5"

2. **Check Driver**: Make sure you're using the Star TSP100 driver, not generic text driver

3. **Alternative Character Sets**: If Big5 doesn't work, try:
   - Unicode mode
   - Different Traditional Chinese variants in printer settings

## Server Features 📋

Your enhanced server now:
- ✅ Automatically detects Traditional vs Simplified Chinese
- ✅ Uses Big5 encoding for Traditional Chinese
- ✅ Uses GBK/GB2312 for Simplified Chinese  
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if one encoding fails
- ✅ Supports mixed character sets in the same document
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with English text

## Next Steps 🚀

1. Test all character sets using the methods above
2. If Traditional Chinese works, you can integrate with your HK Savor Spoon web application
3. The API endpoint is: `POST http://localhost:5000/print` with JSON: `{"text": "your text", "api_key": "hk_savor_spoon_2024"}`

Your server is ready for production use! 🎉
